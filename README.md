# iTenda - Smart Roller Blind Project

## Overview

Welcome to iTenda, a groundbreaking project focused on designing and engineering a smart roller blind. The initiative arose from the need to streamline the daily task of opening and closing roller blinds, a requirement that gained prominence during the lockdown period. iTenda, belonging to the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, stands out for its user-friendly interface, customization options, and adaptive functionality tailored to user needs.

## Project Highlights

### System Design and Implementation

The project seamlessly divides into two core components: the physical system and the software system.

#### Physical System

The physical system incorporates a combination of hardware and software, integrating diverse sensors and a microcontroller responsible for the precise control of the roller blind's movement.

#### Software System

The software system empowers users with multiple control options, including motion sensors, voice commands (via Google Assistant), light sensors, and customizable pre-set schedules.

### Tools Utilized

The project leverages a suite of cutting-edge tools and technologies to ensure optimal performance:

- **Programming:** Python, Zerynth for microcontroller programming
- **Messaging:** MQTT for seamless communication
- **Integration:** IFTTT for Google Assistant integration

### Final Result

The culmination of the project is a standalone system, configurable solely through code. Each constituent, from the ESP32 microcontroller to the array of sensors, harmoniously integrates into a unified and efficient product.

### Software System and Interface

The software interface provides a user-friendly platform for effortless modification of settings, facilitating seamless interaction with the physical system. The development stack includes Ionic, HTML, CSS, Angular, PHP, and a robust database.

### Integration and Testing

The conclusive phase involves meticulous integration of diverse modules and rigorous testing, ensuring the system's reliability and functionality across diverse conditions.

## Project Success

iTenda successfully achieves its objectives, delivering a practical, user-friendly, and plug-and-play solution that revolutionizes the operation of roller blinds. This project reflects not only technological innovation but also a deep understanding of user needs in the evolving landscape of smart home solutions.
